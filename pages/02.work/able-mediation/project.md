# Able Mediation
Brand creation and maintenance

Able Mediation are a West London based Family Mediation Practice that I have worked with on multiple projects over the last few years.

I worked with Juliet Wilkinson and Nasrin Grayson of Able Mediation to develop their logo and visual identity, applying it to business cards, a promotional leaflet, and content managed website, built with WordPress.

A few months later, I helped Juliet and Nasrin to update their online presence, implementing more calls to action on the website, and branding their Google Plus page. I also made the site more self sufficient on the admin side of the website, coding utilities into the theme that were previously reliant upon plugins.
