# TFL The Tube
An experiment in User Experience design

---

In application to a job at a service design company, I answered a User Experience (UX) design brief. The brief asked me to visualise in six steps how a journey on London Underground could run more smoothly for new users of the service.

Inspired by this brief, I went on to map out the user flow in a potential mobile app, also mocking up still screens shown as the user makes their way through the transport system. Facets covered include ticketing systems, wayfinding at different stages, and personal safety.

## 1: Visualising the user experience
