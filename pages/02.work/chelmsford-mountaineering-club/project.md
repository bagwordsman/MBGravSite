# Chelmsford Mountaineering Club
Refreshing Print and Digital Design

---

I have helped my local rock climbing club out in the past with print and digital based design, refreshing the appearance of their communications.

In print format, I designed a new membership form and membership card template, a promotional flyer, and calendars for three consecutive years. In digital format, I put together annual newsletters, illustrating members stories (including some of my own), and sent out HTML emails to advertise trips to club members.

Aiming to standardise and simplify the design across different media, I picked a more legible main font, and separated information in a clearer way using colour, font weight, and spacing.
