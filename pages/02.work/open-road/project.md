# Open Road
Open Mind - Digital Newsletter

---

I designed an issue of Open Mind newsletter for Open Road, a charity that provides support for individuals affected by drug and alcohol in Essex and Suffolk. This was a one-off newsletter that featured stories from service users and staff at the Chelmsford centre as part of the charity's annual ‘Recovery Month’. Held in June every year, ‘Recovery Month’ is a series of public events and activities that show how Open Road helps people to lead lives free from substance addiction.

I followed the Open Road brand guidelines, adding my own illustrations that align to their signature style of a continuous neon red line bleeding off the page.
